# Hiragana-Katakana-Trainer
This is a simple and my very first GUI app made from Python. This app is meant to make people learn Hiragana and Katakana easier.

# Setup
Clone this repo to local machine or downlaod them directly from github. Make sure that the `hkTrainer main.py` file is in the `Hiragana Katakana Trainer` directory. Moving the main py file will cause this app to fail.
